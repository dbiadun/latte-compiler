# Latte Compiler
This program is a compiler of the Latte programming language.
Unfortunately, it can't yet compile any code.
It only performs semantic analysis for now. 

## Compilation and running
To compile the compiler simply use `make`.
You will need `ghc` to do that.
It will create compiler executable `./latc`.
